## Repository Overview

This repository contains a set of tools for performing pass-the-hash attacks using Docker.

The toolkit includes the following tools:
- pth-curl
- pth-net
- pth-rpcclient
- pth-smbclient
- pth-smbget
- pth-sqsh
- pth-winexe
- pth-wmic
- pth-wmis

To use the `pth-toolkit`, you can run the following command:

```sh
pth-toolkit() { docker run --rm -it --network host nechry/pth-toolkit:latest "$@"; }
```

the network is configured in host mode, this option makes the Docker container use the hostâ€™s network stack directly, rather than an isolated Docker network.
Useful for direct access to interfaces like tun0 for usage with a VPN.

Example usage:

```sh
pth-toolkit pth-net rpc password --help
```
